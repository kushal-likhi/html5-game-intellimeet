html5-game-intellimeet
======================

Repository defining code for tutorials on HTML5 game development.

##Getting Started##

* Clone this git repo
* Make sure Node is installed in your PC. (We need node only for a light weight web server to serve a static folder, its better than configuring Apache2 ;)). See **how to install node** section below for help in this step.
* From terminal go to the project root and run following commands.
```bash
$> npm install
$> npm start
```
* Open the displayed URL and all should be working.


##How to install NodeJS##
* Download system specific binary from <<>>
* Extract it in the `/opt/<extracted folder name>` folder, or any other folder of your choice.
* Put `/opt/<extracted folder name>` in your path. (Same way as we install grails, etc.)
* Run `node` and it should launch the Node REPL. All set.
